# Oracle Linux Hands-On Labs

This repository contains hands-on lab documentation that instructs users on how
to install and configure various Oracle Linux components with a specific 
demonstrable service.

Included with each lab are sample scripts that can be used to create the initial
environment using [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://virtualbox.org) and 
[Vagrant by HashiCorp](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
